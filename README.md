* Problem Statement

In this project we are trying to decide whether comments on the internet are toxic or not.  
Withincreasing number of people coming online everyday, we are having more diverse and constructiveconversations which is enabling us to better understand different views and beliefs.
But with morepeople being connected online there are handful of bigoted people trying to suppress the conversationsby spewing their racist and harmful believes. 
There is an inherent need for stopping these type ofobjectively vile comments which ceases the open and constructive conversations. 
In this project weare working toward identifying these harmful comments and classify them efficiently. 
The traditionalmachine learning approach like logistic regression, SVM etc. have limited capacity of understandingsentences with bag of words approach. 
Most of the traditional approach lacks in preserving contextof the word which can lead to miss-classification of even constructive criticism as toxic. 
In recentdecade, there has been numerous development in the field of NLP with the resurgence of deeplearning. 
These deep learning models including deep Multi-layer perception, Convolutional NeuralNetwork and Long Short term memory has time to time proven to perform excellently for variousNLP tasks. 
Since the data-set we are using is quite skewed, we also wanted to test the robustness ofthese models against our data and compare that with that of the traditional models.
